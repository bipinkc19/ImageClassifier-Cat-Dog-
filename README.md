# Image Classifier for Cat or Dog
- Used an simple CNN to implment the technique in which acheived around 74% accuracy using 8000 test and 2000 train images.
- Used transfer learning from inceptionv3 and adding a single dense layer at the end of it.
- Acheives 100% acuuracy from transfer learning as inceptionv3 is already trained for cat or dog.

## Used tensorflow to train the model.
## Created beautiful vizualization of graphs and accuracy growth in tensorboard.
## Used Beholder to see whoch nodes are being trained and which are useless.
## Used pickle to load and train imgaes after augmentation in Keras.
